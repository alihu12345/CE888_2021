## Lab 6: Data Exploration <a name="DE"></a>

Please open [notebook](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_6/Lab_6_Exercise.ipynb) in Colab and complete all the tasks. 

## Lab 6: Data Exploration 

**Task 1:** Check the counts of each wine class

**Task 2:** Cluster wine data using K Means Algorithm

**Task 3:** Scatter plot wine data into 3 classes based on True Labels and plot with legends. **Hint**: use any two variables

**Task 4:** Use cluster model labels to group data based on predicted classes

**Task 5:** Apply PCA with n_components=2 on X_train_std wine data and transform test data accordingly

**Task 6:** Apply Logistic Regression on training features and predict test features

## Lab 6: Exercise to be completed

Task 7: To complete this task, please create a new notebook in Google Colab. 

Your data is stored in Lab_6/Data folder. There are two .csv files: 1) Country-data.csv and 2) data-dictionary.csv. Please explore the data and use any clustering method to find the list of countries, which can categorised as follows:

| S.No      | Categories |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | under-developing country |
| 2   | developing country       |
| 3   | developed country        |


Note: please justify your reason, why and how you have concluded your answer.
